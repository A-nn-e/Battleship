# Battleship different algorithms

## Khushi singh- backtracking plus pruning 

* Inorder to run kindly open the ipynb file and to see the code of the two important files the backtracking_pruning.py and puzzle.py can be used. Both of them have been uploaded in the drive and downloaded in the colab to be used.
* The algorithm prints two solutions :
  * the solution 1 is gained by backtracking and contraint checking 
  * the solution 2 is gained by optimising the solution by adding more contsraints to get an optimal board
* The algo has been tried on different set of puzzles some examples are shown below: 

#### 6 X 6 board with (battleships : 0 || cruisers : 1 || submarines : 2 || destroyers : 3)

average time taken : 1.719 seconds
