A 6Ã—6 Battleship puzzle solved using genetic algorithm.

***Board Information:***
- N = 6
- Number of ships = 4
- Number and Types of ships: 1 Cruiser, 2 Destroyers, 3 Submarines
- Number of ship segments = 10
- Row-wise ship segment distribution: 3,1,2,1,2,1
- Column-wise ship segment distribution: 1,0,2,2,3,2
- 0s represent water and 1s represent ships

After running the algorithm with population size and generation limit in the range 10-15000, a significant increase in the accuracy was observed. However, an increase in these two paramenters also increased the average run time of the program from 0.921 seconds to 6.803 seconds.
